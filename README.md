# MCTest v. 5.1 (or webMCTest 1.1)

Welcome to MCTest, a website devoted to assist in preparing and correcting exams.

MCTest is a free open-source software (see [License](License.txt)), and its best 
advantage is the handling to parametric questions through 
![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) and Python, 
**allowing for infinite variations of each same question**.

Please access [vision.ufabc.edu.br:8000](http://vision.ufabc.edu.br:8000)
for some [examples](http://vision.ufabc.edu.br/MCTest/MCTest5-Experiments/).

#### Help us spread MCTest. If more people use it, the faster the improvements.

MCTest must be installed on an Ubuntu 18.04 server through ports 3306 and 8000.

Define specific data in the file [_settings.env](_settings.env).

### After downloading in [github.com/fzampirolli/mctest](https://github.com/fzampirolli/mctest), install MCTest with:
```
sudo su
source _setup_all.sh 
```

### Future Improvements
1) Error messages and graphical interfaces;
 
2) Install [_setup-all.sh](_setup-all.sh) (including other operating systems);

3) The time to generate PDF from an exam with many students.

4) Site and DB in different languages. For example, 
   edit the [locale/pt/LC_MESSAGES/django.po](locale/pt/LC_MESSAGES/django.po) 
   for Portuguese and use the commands:
   ```
   django-admin.py makemessages -l pt
   django-admin.py compilemessages
   ```

   Afterwards make the following changes in [_settings.env](_settings.env):
   ```
   LANGUAGE_CODE = 'pt-br'
   TIME_ZONE = 'America/Sao_Paulo'
   ```

   Please see [locale](locale) for other languages;

5) AI Exams Module: individual exams based on the students and the class history;

6) AI Students Module: evaluation of how the weigh questions in order to show the 
   skills and abilities of each student;

7) Use of blockchain to validate exams, history and other features;

8) Inclusion of facial recognition in the QR Code of the exams;

9) Improve of Item Response Theory;  

10) Use Markdown to describe questions and send exams or activities to students;

11) Adapt the Android application to this version of MCTest [[ref15](http://www.lbd.dcc.ufmg.br/colecoes/wvc/2015/018.pdf), [ref16b](https://itp.ifsp.edu.br/ojs/index.php/IC/article/viewFile/221/394)];

12) Study the integration of MCTest with other systems, for example, SIGAA and Moodle, sharing different databases;

13) Run the parametric question codes on other servers, similar to those used in the Moodle VPL plug-in;

14) Integrate with [MakeTests](https://github.com/fernandoteubl/MakeTests);

15) Write a complete tutorial to install and use MCTest.

### I would like to collaborate with experts to write articles or technical reports
A maximum of 5 authors per article; Authors' order proportional to the number of pages written; I already have data/implementations for some topics:

1) Security in exams using QRcode;

2) Exams with multiple-choice questions and different weights in the answers;

3) Answer sheet design comparisons;

4) A case study using Item Response Theory;

5) Individualized online activities with multiple-choice parametric questions;

6) MCTest: Software Requirements Specification;

7) MCTest: graphic interface;

8) MCTest: data base;

9) MCTest: software architecture;

10) MCTest: software deployment;

11) Individualized parametric questions using MCTest+Moodle+VPL (I already have the 4 co-authors).
